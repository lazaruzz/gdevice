Gdevice is a lightweight **Parallel Computing framework** designed to run CPU and GPU programs promiscuously and maximize general purpose computational power within real-time applications written in C++.

Dependencies: 
- C++
- Visual Studio 2008
- OpenGL 4.5
- Windows

The demo application features some of the typical 3D engine features:
- Scene graph
- Rendering
- Processing
- Procedural generation
- Terrain LOD

### Motivation
Some of the best practices, wisely applied in the good professional environments, are overhauled in this hobby project for learning purposes and particularly for answering questions like:

- Can a 3D engine solution **build in seconds**, like 5 seconds?
- What would the **simplest design** look like?
- Can source code be written in **DRY C++**, like Java?
- How can a **continuous-unsandboxed terrain LOD** scheme work?
- How realistic can a **Quasi Physically-Based Rendering** get?
- Is some kind of **global illumination** possible **without backing**?
- What about **atmospheric scattering** and **volumetric rendering**?
- What can **procedurally generated content** be used for?
- Can **materials** (albedo, normals, etc.) be **generated at run-time**?
